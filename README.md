# sbf_reader
One day I came across data files from a program related to real estate ads.
The files have the *.sbf extension. I wanted to read the raw data from these files, but no program from the internet could read them. 
So I decided to understand how data is stored in these files, and wrote a program to read data from sbf files.

Example of a file header:

The following is a description of the fields:
